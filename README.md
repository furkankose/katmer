## What is katmer?

**katmer** (named after the traditional Turkish layered dessert, from the word *"kat"*
meaning "layer", pronounced /kaˈtmer/) is a modular infrastructure management framework
designed to simplify how infrastructure is defined, composed, and executed.

It emphasizes building systems from clear, reusable layers that adapt across operating systems, architectures, and
environments.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Compose infrastructure from reusable, versioned modules
- **Multi-Platform**: Support for various operating systems and architectures
- **Type-Safe Configuration**: Strong typing with runtime validation
- **Beautiful Installation Experience**: Auto-generated UI from configuration schemas
- **Remote Management**: Built-in SSH and remote execution capabilities
- **Extensible**: Plugin system for custom functionality
